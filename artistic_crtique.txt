The video is a video of a dutch rock band named Focus doing a live performance on October 5, 1973. The first song is called "Hocus Pocus". The entire video has scrolling japanese characters at the bottom while the members of Focus vibe out in the background. Their music consists of rock mixed with yodelling and screaming. 10/10 would attend a live performance near me.
